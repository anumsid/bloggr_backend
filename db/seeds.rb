The Colosseum was a large amphitheatre constructed by the Emperors of Rome to entertain the masses with gladiatorial shows and hunts of wild animals.  In 80 AD the Colosseum was completed and an inauguration lasting 100 days was held, all shows being free with seats being allocated according to the class of spectator.  Viewing the iconic Colosseum was an impressive sight as it is one of the most recognisable monuments of Ancient Rome.", user_id: user1.id, date: "August 1, 2018")
